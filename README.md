# express-session-json-store
JSON file sessions store for Express

forked [https://github.com/darul75/express-session-json] for **NOT** saving the json file on every request (instead: having a timeout and write the file if there are changes).


## Usage

express version >= 4

```javascript
var express = require('express'),
    cookieParser = require('cookie-parser'),
    session = require('express-session') ,
    JsonStore = require('express-session-json-store')(session);

var app = express();
app.use(cookieParser('your secret here'));
app.use(session({
    secret: 'your secret here' ,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new JsonStore()
});

```

Example for express < 4:

```javascript
var express = require('express'),
    JsonStore = require('express-session-json')(express.session);

var app = express();
app.configure(function(){    
    app.use(express.cookieParser('your secret here'));
    app.use(express.session({ store: new JsonStore({save}) }));
});

```


## Options

- **filename** : filename, default 'sessions.json'
- **path** : directory where to save, default './sessions'
- **ttl** : how long is the session valid in milliseconds, default 60min
- **saveInterval** : save every xx if something changed in milliseconds, default 5min
